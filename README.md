## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

```sh
gatsby new project-name 
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd project-name
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) 

## 📝 Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Changing content

The content of this project is defined in four `.mdx` files inside the theme's `sections` folder. You can override the files `intro.mdx`, `projects.mdx`, `about.mdx` and `contact.mdx`. This starter has overriden the `intro.mdx` file as an example. Place the other files in the same `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/sections/` folder.

You have to use the `<ProjectCard />` component inside `projects.mdx` to display the cards. Example:

```md
## Projects

<ProjectCard title="Freiheit" link="https://www.behance.net/gallery/58937147/Freiheit" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
This project is my entry to Adobe's #ChallengeYourPerspective contest.
</ProjectCard>
```

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
